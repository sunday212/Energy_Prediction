\f0\fs24 \cf0 Title: Energy forecasting\
Author: Lisa Mok\
\
Dataset: GEFCom2014\
\
Project Description: This exercise uses temperature, humidity, months of the year and days of the week to train a Long Short Term Memory neural network to predict energy load. \
\
Project Details: The script demonstrates the steps undertaken in the machine learning process after selection of an appropriate model (LSTM in this case) starting from data preparation, then going into data exploration, data reframing, data splitting, model definition, parameter tuning, model evaluation and then final model training and energy load prediction.\
\
Acknowledgements: I would to thank Jason Brownlee of machinelearningmastery.com for his intuitive guide to machine learning which has enabled me to create usable scripts for implementing machine learning and getting results.\
